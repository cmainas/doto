# Doto 

Doto is a simple cli todo calendar.

The only thing you need to do is to clone this repo and type make.
(build-essential must be installed).

Upon start doto pops out a menu that shows all the supported options. 

It stores all the info in a file named .doto\_file at your home directory, but 
not in human readable format.
